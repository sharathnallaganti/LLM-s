    "# **1. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reads **one word at a time, sequentially**.\n",
    "* Keeps a hidden state that updates with each word.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Step 1: “The” → hidden state h1.\n",
    "  * Step 2: “dog” → h2 depends on h1.\n",
    "  * Step 10: “neighbors” → h10 depends on h9.\n",
    "  * Step 15: “angry” → h15 depends on everything before it (compressed into a single state).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Impact**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When translating “made them very angry,” the model may have already **lost context** of *“dog barked all night”*.\n",
    "* LSTM struggles to maintain links between *cause* (“barked all night”) and *effect* (“neighbors angry”) because those words are far apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Likely translation might miss nuance:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * “Le chien a aboyé la nuit. Les voisins étaient très fâchés.”\n",
    "    (Drops the causal connection).\n",

    "# **2. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Same **step-by-step** style as LSTM but with **simpler gates** (reset/update).\n",
    "* Slightly faster, fewer parameters.\n",
    "* Still: “angry” (last word) depends indirectly on “dog” (first word) via 14 updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Impact**\n",
    "\n",
    "* GRU retains context a little better for medium-length sentences.\n",
    "* But with **15 words**, still suffers from **vanishing dependency strength**.\n",
    "* It knows *neighbors were angry* but not strongly *why*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Translation slightly better but still weak:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * “Le chien a aboyé toute la nuit. Les voisins étaient très fâchés.”\n",
    "    (Captures both sentences, but **loses cause-effect link** “kept awake → angry”).\n",

    "#  **3. Transformer**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Processes **all words in parallel** with self-attention.\n",
    "* At each layer, every word **looks at every other word directly**.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * “neighbors” attends strongly to “kept awake.”\n",
    "  * “angry” attends strongly to “barked all night.”\n",
    "  * “dog” attends to “barked.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Impact**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Long-range dependencies preserved: *barking all night* is directly tied to *angry neighbors*.\n",
    "* Multiple attention heads capture **different relationships**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Head 1: subject–verb (*dog ↔ barked*).\n",
    "  * Head 2: cause–effect (*barked ↔ angry*).\n",
    "  * Head 3: time (*all night ↔ kept awake*).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Translation is accurate and keeps causal meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * “Le chien qui a aboyé toute la nuit a empêché les voisins de dormir et les a rendus très fâchés.”\n",
